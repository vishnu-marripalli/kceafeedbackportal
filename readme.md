# College Feedback Portal

## Overview

The College Feedback Portal is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate effective communication between students and the college administration. This portal enables students to submit feedback, complaints, and anti-ragging reports, ensuring their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed promptly. Faculty and administrative staff can review and act on these submissions, fostering a more responsive and supportive college environment. The project leverages modern web development technologies to create a user-friendly and efficient platform.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages to ensure they are visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Used for adding interactivity and dynamic content to the web pages.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data, feedback, complaints, and anti-ragging reports.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to interact with the MongoDB database.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine used to generate HTML with embedded JavaScript.
- **dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **bcrypt**: A library to hash passwords for secure storage.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: A library to create and verify JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **express-session**: A middleware to manage sessions.
- **connect-mongo**: A MongoDB session store for Express.js.
- **cookie-parser**: A middleware to parse cookies.
- **method-override**: A middleware to support HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE in places where the client doesnâ€™t support them.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Frontend**: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the user interface.
   - **HTML**: Defines the structure of the web pages.
   - **CSS**: Styles the web pages for a consistent and appealing look.
   - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
   - **EJS templates**: Dynamically render server-side content on the frontend.

2. **Backend**: Manages server-side logic, data processing, and database interactions.
   - **Express.js Server**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers.
   - **MongoDB with Mongoose**: Manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

3. **Authentication**: Ensures secure user authentication and authorization.
   - **bcrypt**: Hashes passwords to enhance security.
   - **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: Manages user authentication tokens.
   - **express-session**: Manages user sessions, ensuring persistence across multiple requests.

## Features

1. **Home Page**
   - **News Bulletin**: Contains a news bulletin with sliding images to keep students informed about the latest updates and announcements.

2. **Suggestions**
   - **Submit Suggestions**: Allows students to submit their suggestions to improve various aspects of the college, ranging from academic programs to campus activities.
   - **Feedback Review**: Faculty and administrators can review submitted suggestions and take appropriate actions.

3. **Complaints**
   - **Register Complaints**: Provides a platform for students to register their complaints about any issues or concerns they encounter.
   - **Complaint Resolution**: Faculty and administrators can review and resolve registered complaints.

4. **Anti-Ragging**
   - **Report Ragging Incidents**: A dedicated section for reporting incidents of ragging. 
   - **Incident Management**: Faculty and administrators can access and manage reported incidents to maintain campus safety.

5. **Faculty Access**
   - **Secure Access**: Faculty members can log in to access and review suggestions, complaints, and anti-ragging reports.
   - **Action Tracking**: Faculty can update the status of suggestions, complaints, and incidents, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Implementation Details

1. **Server Setup (`server.js`)**
   - Configures the Express.js server and middleware.
   - Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
   - Sets up session management and authentication.

2. **Models**
   - **User Model (`models/User.js`)**: Defines the schema for storing user information, including username and hashed password.
   - **Feedback Model (`models/Feedback.js`)**: Defines the schema for storing feedback, complaints, and anti-ragging reports, including the type of feedback, content, and user reference.

3. **Routes**
   - **Authentication Routes (`routes/auth.js`)**: Manages user registration, login, and logout. This ensures that users can securely create accounts and access the portal.
   - **Feedback Routes (`routes/feedback.js`)**: Manages submission and retrieval of feedback, complaints, and anti-ragging reports. This allows students to submit their feedback and faculty to review it.

4. **Middleware**
   - **Authentication Middleware (`middlewares/auth.js`)**: Ensures that routes requiring authentication are protected. This middleware checks for valid JWT tokens and grants access accordingly.

5. **Environment Variables**
   - **Configuration**: Stores sensitive configuration settings such as database URI and secret keys in a `.env` file. This ensures that these settings are not hard-coded into the application and can be easily managed and secured.

## Conclusion

The College Feedback Portal is a robust and user-friendly solution aimed at improving communication within the college community. By leveraging modern web development technologies, it ensures that students can easily submit feedback and complaints, and faculty can efficiently address these issues. This project not only enhances the overall college experience but also promotes a culture of transparency and responsiveness. It serves as an essential tool for maintaining a positive and inclusive environment on campus.
